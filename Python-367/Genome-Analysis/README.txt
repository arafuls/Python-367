Description:
This program can be used as a tool to report the expected frequency
of a specific hypothetical motif in a number of different ways. Analyzing
and searching genetic code for patterns is an important aspect for
determining whether genetic material is functional or non-functional as
we once thought it to be.

One of the keys in bioinformatic research is calculating the likelyhood
of finding specific motifs amongst random sequences. If a specific
hypothetical motif occurs more frequently in the genome than the
expected frequency, it can be understood that the motif is doing something
significant.

How to use the program:
Enter in a hypothetical genome consisting of A, T, C, and G's.
Ex. CGGA

Then enter the frequency at which each nucleotide exists out of 100%.
Ex. A: 20%, T: 27%, G: 19%, C: 34%
